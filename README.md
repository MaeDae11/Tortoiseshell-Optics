Codecademy Ready Project: Responsive Websites with rem

The Tortoiseshell Optics website focused on the use of rem to create a responsive website. 

After a solid foundation for a desktop version was created, there was an addition of @media for max-width 1024px and 470px.
With this, we incorporated display: hidden to change different features, for example, a complete menu list displayed on larger screens to shrink to the singular menu option on smaller screens. 


The course is still working stricktly with CSS and HTML; however, we will be starting in on Javascript shortly. I'm excited to see the impact such a powerful language can have. 

Overall:
I actually quite liked working with rem measurments. I know that the standard currently is going back to px, but it was an interesting deviation and good to know that how rem can be used.

Difficulties:
This project went by much quicker than the past ones. CSS flexbox is becoming more natural. The biggest issues were the images as they were originally different sizes. I found it easier to simply change the actual file / image size then add them to the HTML or CSS file.
